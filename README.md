Title:  Productive Go

Subtitle: Three reasons why Go is fun to work with (even after seven years).

Abstract: The Go programming language is a stable and efficient programming
language that can even be fun to work with. After using the language for a
couple of years, I want to take a step back and highlight three areas where Go
strikes me as a productive language: Performance, Ergonomics and Deployment.

This talk does not introduce Go, but rather tells three short stories with code
- and tries to find out what a language that has been criticized as being
"stuck in the 70s" can teach us about software development today.
