Title:  Productive Go

Subtitle: Three reasons why Go is fun to work with (even after seven years).

Abstract: The Go programming language is a stable and efficient programming
language that can even be fun to work with. This talk highlights three areas
of productive Go: Performance, Ergonomics and Deployment. This talk does not
introduce Go, but rather tells three short stories with code - and tries to
find out what a language that has been critized as being "stuck in the 70s"
can teach us about software development today.
